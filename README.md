# Wolfie's Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction Loot Filters

I have created a Discord so that you can be notified when I update my filter. Take a look [HERE](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/lodfilter#discord) for more info!  
Looking for a PlugY Stash to test the filter? Check it out [HERE](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/LoD-PlugY-Stash)!  
Looking for my PD2 filters? Check them out [HERE](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter)!

**TOO MANY BLUE OR WHITE ITEMS?**  
Check the "Magic Items Master" and "Base Items Master" sections.  
Please also look at the instructions under the "Base Items" header.

* Having two installations and pasting your filter into the wrong one
* Saving the filter file with the wrong name, eg **default.filter.filter**, **default.txt**, or **default.filter.txt**
* Having a D2 installation inside of a Diablo II folder which is inside another Diablo II folder (folderception!)
* Not saving and closing the filter file after pasting into it

# FAQ
**Read the [Common Issues](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/lodfilter#common-issues) above if the FAQ does not help.**

* **How do I turn off the filter / go back to original?**
  * Turn off `Advanced Item Display` in the in-game settings, close your game and launcher, delete `default.filter` and `loot.filter` in the Diablo II folder, and then reload the game
* **My Settings button is gone?**
  * Close the game & the launcher, delete `UI.ini`, and then relaunch the game. Note you may have to redo your settings (look at the image in [Common Issues](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/lodfilter#common-issues))

For all versions of the filter I take no responsibility for any items that are accidentally hidden and/or do not notify. I do try my best to test these filters and ensure they are working properly but there's always room for error.
